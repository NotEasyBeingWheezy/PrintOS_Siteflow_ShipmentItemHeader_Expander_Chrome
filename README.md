Technical Details

Files Explained
manifest.json: Configuration file that tells Chrome about the extension, its permissions, and which files to use
popup.html: The visual interface users see when clicking the extension icon
popup.js: Handles button clicks and communicates with the content script
content.js: Runs on the PrintOS website and performs the actual section expansion
styles.css: Makes the popup look professional and user-friendly

How It Works
The extension only activates on the specified PrintOS domain
When you click "Expand All Sections", the popup sends a message to the content script
The content script searches for all <header> elements with class ShipmentItemHeader
It adds the class ShipmentItemHeader--expanded to each found header
The website's existing CSS handles the visual expansion
Results are reported back to the popup for user feedback
